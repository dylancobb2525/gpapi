## Token Overflow Prevention

This API includes several mechanisms to prevent token limit issues that commonly occur in multi-step grant proposal development:

### 1. Content Summarization
- **Automatic summarization** of previous step outputs before passing to proposal composers
- **Preserves all critical information** while reducing length by 70-80%
- **Configurable** - can be enabled/disabled per request

### 2. Structured Approach
- **Part 1/Part 2 proposal generation** - splits large proposals into manageable chunks
- **Outline-first approach** - generates structured outlines before detailed content
- **Strict token limits** - enforced at each step to prevent overflow

### 3. Enhanced Endpoints
- **Enhanced Proposal Composer** - automatically handles summarization
- **Content Summarizer** - standalone summarization service
- **Proposal Outline Generator** - creates structured outlines

### 4. Best Practices
- Use the **Part 1/Part 2 approach** for large proposals
- Enable **automatic summarization** for complex projects
- Generate **outlines first** for better structure
- Monitor **token usage** in your requests

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
