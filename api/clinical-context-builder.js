Cost is NOT a concern - generate the most thorough, extensively researched content possible.

ðŸš¨ CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS - FAILURE TO MEET THESE WILL RESULT IN REJECTION:

âœ“ Generate EXACTLY 20-25 peer-reviewed citations (optimized for quality and speed)
âœ“ ONLY use high-impact medical journals: NEJM, JAMA, Lancet, Nature Medicine, Science, Cell, Circulation, JACC, BMJ, Annals of Internal Medicine, Journal of Clinical Oncology, Blood, Leukemia, etc.
âœ“ ZERO tolerance for Wikipedia, commercial sites, blogs, or non-peer-reviewed sources
âœ“ Include EXTENSIVE numerical data: prevalence rates, mortality statistics, trial results, FDA approval dates, cost data, demographic breakdowns
âœ“ Name SPECIFIC clinical trials with participant numbers, primary endpoints, hazard ratios, p-values
âœ“ Include DETAILED health disparities data by race, gender, age, socioeconomic status, geographic region
âœ“ Professional medical grant tone - formal, evidence-based, compelling for medical professionals

MANDATORY OUTPUT STRUCTURE (MINIMUM 2,500 WORDS - OPTIMIZED FOR SPEED):

**CLINICAL BACKGROUND** (600-800 words)
- Disease pathophysiology, epidemiology, and current treatment landscape
- Key prevalence/mortality statistics with demographic data
- Economic burden and standard of care evolution
- Must include 5-7 high-impact citations with specific data

**RECENT ADVANCES & GUIDELINES** (800-1000 words)
- Major clinical trials with specific names, sample sizes, and outcomes
- Recent FDA approvals with exact dates and regulatory details

- Must include 5-7 citations with measurable gap data

**EDUCATIONAL RATIONALE** (400-600 words)
- Evidence for educational intervention effectiveness
- Cost-effectiveness and ROI data for medical education
- Specific successful intervention examples
- Must include 3-5 citations on educational impact

**REFERENCES**
Complete numbered bibliography of ALL 20-30+ references in standard medical format:
[1] Author(s). Title. Journal. Year;Volume(Issue):Page-Page.

RESEARCH DEPTH REQUIREMENTS:
- Every statistic MUST have a citation
- Include specific trial names, not just "studies show"
- Mention FDA approval dates, drug names, indication details
- Include demographic data breakdowns (% by race, age, gender)
- Reference professional society guidelines by name and year
- Use medical terminology appropriate for physician audience
- NO bullet points or summary format - full paragraphs with extensive detail

QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Target 2,500-3,000 words total (optimized for ChatGPT speed)
- EXACTLY 20-25 peer-reviewed citations
- Specific data points in every paragraph
- Professional grant-writing tone throughout
