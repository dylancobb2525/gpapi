Cost is NOT a concern - generate the most thorough, extensively researched content possible.

ðŸš¨ CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS - FAILURE TO MEET THESE WILL RESULT IN REJECTION:

âœ“ Generate MINIMUM 20-25 peer-reviewed citations (more is better - aim for 30+)
âœ“ ONLY use high-impact medical journals: NEJM, JAMA, Lancet, Nature Medicine, Science, Cell, Circulation, JACC, BMJ, Annals of Internal Medicine, Journal of Clinical Oncology, Blood, Leukemia, etc.
âœ“ ZERO tolerance for Wikipedia, commercial sites, blogs, or non-peer-reviewed sources
âœ“ Include EXTENSIVE numerical data: prevalence rates, mortality statistics, trial results, FDA approval dates, cost data, demographic breakdowns
âœ“ Name SPECIFIC clinical trials with participant numbers, primary endpoints, hazard ratios, p-values
âœ“ Include DETAILED health disparities data by race, gender, age, socioeconomic status, geographic region
âœ“ Professional medical grant tone - formal, evidence-based, compelling for medical professionals

MANDATORY OUTPUT STRUCTURE (MINIMUM 3,500 WORDS):

**CLINICAL BACKGROUND** (800-1000 words)
- Comprehensive disease pathophysiology and epidemiology
- Global and US prevalence data with specific statistics
- Mortality/morbidity burden with demographic breakdowns
- Economic impact data (healthcare costs, productivity loss)
- Standard of care evolution and current treatment paradigms
- Must include 6-8 citations with specific data points

**RECENT DATA & GUIDELINES** (1000-1200 words)
- Latest pivotal clinical trials (name studies, n=participants, primary endpoints)
- FDA approvals with EXACT dates (month/year) and regulatory pathways
- Recent guideline updates from professional societies (AHA, ACC, NCCN, ASCO, etc.)
- Emerging therapies in pipeline with trial data
- Real-world evidence studies and registry data
- Must include 8-10 citations with trial names and statistical outcomes

**UNMET NEEDS & PRACTICE GAPS** (800-1000 words)
- Evidence-backed clinical practice variations with specific percentages
- Medication adherence rates by demographic groups
- Provider knowledge deficits with survey data
- Access disparities by race, insurance, geography with specific statistics
- Quality metrics and performance gaps
- Patient outcome disparities with quantified data
- Must include 6-8 citations with specific percentages and outcomes data

**EDUCATIONAL JUSTIFICATION** (500-700 words)
- Evidence that medical education interventions improve outcomes
- Cost-effectiveness data for educational programs
- Specific examples of successful educational interventions
- Quantified impact on clinical practice and patient outcomes
- ROI data for educational investments
- Must include 4-6 citations demonstrating measurable educational impact

**REFERENCES**
Complete numbered bibliography of ALL 20-30+ references in standard medical format:
[1] Author(s). Title. Journal. Year;Volume(Issue):Page-Page.

RESEARCH DEPTH REQUIREMENTS:
- Every statistic MUST have a citation
- Include specific trial names, not just "studies show"
- Mention FDA approval dates, drug names, indication details
- Include demographic data breakdowns (% by race, age, gender)
- Reference professional society guidelines by name and year
- Use medical terminology appropriate for physician audience
- NO bullet points or summary format - full paragraphs with extensive detail

QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Minimum 3,500 words total
- 20+ peer-reviewed citations (aim for 25-30)
- Specific data points in every paragraph
- Professional grant-writing tone throughout
- Evidence-based statements only

DO NOT give me bullet points or brief summaries. I need COMPREHENSIVE, RESEARCH-INTENSIVE content suitable for major medical grant applications.
